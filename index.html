		“Nearly about a year prior, when I received the results from the advanced subjects test, I was preparing to enter the <mark>Department of Foreign Languages and Literature</mark>. Unfortunately, despite receiving an 88.75 on my English test, I wasn’t able to enter the department. Nonetheless, I have been enthusiastic in literature and linguistics; therefore, I entered the Department of English Instruction. I was expecting that the two departments may be similar, but things turned out to be different.
		</p>
		<p>
		Throughout the freshman year in the Department of English Instruction, I’ve realized the major difference between what I have expected and what I actually received – <u>the inadequacy of basic courses</u>. For instance, the Department of Foreign Languages and Literature offered the course of <sub>Introduction to Western Literature</sub> for an entire year. When I first saw the course Introduction to Western Literature for Children in the Department of English Instruction, I was also expecting a full year of basic literature class to provide me reading competency and comprehension of literary courses. However, it was not until the second semester did I realize that the course was only available for the first semester. Due to the inadequacy of time, we partially learned about basic mythology. Despite the fact that the course still provides an insight into the Greek mythology, I was disappointed that I couldn’t have a chance to learn the late medieval, early modern writing and other classical literature. Knowing that I could have learned more made me reconsider whether studying in this department is the right decision.

		I’ve been working as an editor assistant and a teacher in an English cram school for nearly a year. Based on my teaching experience, I discovered that the courses of the Department of English Instruction were relatively practical-oriented. Courses like Selected Readings on English Picture Books, Making English Picture Books, and English Storytelling Instruction could definitely provide us specific methodology of teaching. However, what I found through my teaching experience was that methodology should not be the base and was also not enough for either acquiring or teaching a language. Beside the practical instruction courses, I am eager to study the origin of English as a language, the essence of English as a culture and even the beauty of English as an art. English should be understood and taught as a tool that could help people communicate as well as expressing the beauty of their culture. Therefore, as far as I am concerned, the courses that are offered by your department could be more helpful and essential for me to study, understand and appreciate English from different perspectives.
		</p>
		<p>
		Apart from the basic classes and teaching experience, I’ve developed a deep interest in different perspectives of language after taking different courses. For instance, I’ve taken the course of Programming Language in the last semester and the course of Language and the Brain in this semester. Taking both courses arouses my interest in learning how amazing it is that language and linguistics work in different areas of our world and our life. These courses inspire me to observe the value of the roles that linguistics and language play in our daily life. Therefore, I was delighted when I realized that the Department of Foreign Languages and Literature offers not only sufficient basic courses of English literature, but also a variety of major courses focusing on linguistics, foreign languages and even interpreting/translating, an essential transition of different languages. Due to my interest in language and linguistics, entering the Department of Foreign Languages and Literature may provide an insight into the language field.
		</p>

		In spite of having multiple practical teaching-related courses offered in the Department of English Instruction, my own teaching experience made me realize that this may not be the perfect path for me to learn what I am really interest in. I have a strong passion for literature and language; therefore, the sufficient basic courses and diverse advanced courses in the Department of Foreign Languages and Literature may be what I’ve been searching for. With real passion and enthusiasm, I am looking forward to receiving a chance to enter the Department of Foreign Languages and Literature.”
