			<h1>Berliner Dom</h1>
			<p>
				The Berlin Cathedral, or Berliner Dom in German, was one of the architectures that I remembered the most during my stay in Berlin. The reason why I had such strong memory for this church wasn’t because I was religious man nor how interested I was in the history of it, yet merely because whenever I got lost in the city, I knew that I could always walk back to the Berlin Cathedral to get home. 
			</p>
			<p>
				I remembered that one night I was a little bit drunk and I wasn’t really familiar with the names of the streets. Yet, there was one thing I knew for sure, and it was the bridge nearby the Berlin Cathedral was on the same street where my hotel was. Despite the fact that I couldn’t speak German, I still tried to asked the passerby for directions to the Berlin Cathedral. In the end, it took about an hour and half for me to finally walk to the bridge. In retrospect, it was quite a scary experience and it could have been dangerous for a drunk foreigner like me to wander alone on the streets at night. However, it was still a unique and unforgettable experience for the trip.

			<h1>柏林大教堂</h1>
			<p>
				柏林大教堂，或是德文的Berliner Dom，是我在柏林的期間其中一座我最有印象的建築物。我對這座教堂印象這麼深刻的原因並不是因為我是個虔誠的信徒，或是我對它的歷史多有興趣。僅僅是因為不論我如何在這座城市迷路，我知道我只要走的回柏林大教堂，我就有辦法回家。
			</p>
			<p>
				我記得有一晚，當時我有點喝醉了又不是很熟悉街道的名字。然而，只有一件事我十分清楚，就是柏林大教堂旁邊的一座小橋跟我下榻的飯店都在同一條街道上。儘管我不會說德文，我還是試著向路人問到教堂的路。最後，我大概花了一個半小時才走到那座橋。事後回想起來，這其實是蠻恐怖的經驗，而像我這麼醉的外國人獨自在半夜的街上遊走蠻危險的。然而，這仍是旅途中一個獨特又難以往懷的經驗。

			<h1>Schloss Charlottenburg</h1>
			<p>
				Apart from the experience I had with the Berlin Cathedral, there were actually many surprises I found in the city. One of the many surprises was the buildings and architecture. While wandering in Berlin in the daytime, I have noticed that the architecture around me was indeed fascinating and majestic. Despite the fact that Berlin was often described as silent and gray, the inside of the architecture was nothing like that. On the contrary, the internal decoration of the buildings was a complete different case - the lavish and bright internal design has created a vivid atmosphere. After a while of googling, I realized that this type of architecture style is called the Baroque style.
			</p>
			<p>
				As a matter of fact, many of the architectures in Berlin were built during the 17th century, when the Baroque style flourished the entire Europe. For instance, Schloss Charlottenburg, one of most renowned palaces in Germany, was built at the end of the 17th century. Located on the west side of Berlin, this museum and park was originally the palace commissioned by Sophie Charlotte, the wife of Friedrich I. Therefore, many artists were invited to decorate the interior, including portraits of the royal family and frescos on the ceilings and the walls. Unfortunately, the palace was damaged during the Second World War. However, after many years of restoration, the nearly destroyed piece of art was built to its former condition.

			<h1>夏洛騰堡宮</h1>
			<p>
				有別於先前和柏林大教堂有關的經驗，我在這座城市裡發現到了許多意料之外的事。其中一個便是那些建築物。我在白天的柏林閒晃時，有注意到了周圍的建築物都是如此令人著迷和壯觀。儘管柏林常被形容為沉寂和灰暗的，這些建築物的內部卻不是這麼一回事。相反的，這些建築物的內部裝飾是完全不同的—奢華明亮的內部設計製造出了一種鮮明的氛圍。在我上網搜尋了一回兒後，我得知這種建築方式是叫做巴洛克式。
			<p>
				事實上，許多柏林的建築物都是在十七世紀時建造的，而那正是巴洛克式風格席捲歐洲的時候。舉例來說，夏洛騰堡宮，德國最著名的宮殿之一，正是在十七世紀末期建造完成的。坐落於柏林的西側，這座博物館和休閒公園原先是由腓特烈一世的妻子索菲·夏洛特委託設計的。因此，許多藝術家都受邀至宮殿內設計內部裝潢，這其中包括了皇室家族的肖像畫和天花板以及牆壁上的濕壁畫。不幸的事，這座宮殿在第二次世界大戰時受到的破壞。然而，在多年的修復後，原先近乎全毀的這座如藝術品般的宮殿回復到了昔日的盛況。
