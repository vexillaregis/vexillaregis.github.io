			<h1>Windmill</h1>
			<p>
				When speaking of the Netherlands, one of the very first things that pops up into one’s mind is probably the mass amount of windmills. The Dutch have a long relationship battling the country’s waters, and the windmills have thus become one of the solutions. With the nation’s perfect geological location, the Dutch successfully utilized the wind energy and transferred it into rotation energy, which were used for pumping water out of the lowland or grinding agriculture products. It is estimated that there are currently over 1,000 windmills existing in the nation, and some of them are still being used for drainage. No wonder the Netherlands is also known as the “land of windmills”.
			</p>
			<p>
				Among the attractions in the whole nation, Zaanse Schans is best known for its well-preserved windmill collections. Therefore, on the second day of my trip to the Netherlands, I decided to visit Zaanse Schans. Due to the fact that the place I was staying was pretty close to Zaanse Schans, it didn’t took me too long to get there. As soon as I stepped out of the bus, I was stunned by the majestic landscape. The ancient yet well preserved windmills along with the vast farmland and the clear river formed a breathtaking scenery. No words could perfectly describe my feelings then.
			</p>
			<p>
				There was as well something that has quite impressed me - the 
				wind. In order to make the windmills spin, the wind in Zaanse Schans was incredibly strong, and this was spoken from someone who had lived in the Hsinchu, also known as the “city of wind”, for nearly two years. Luckily, there was the Zaans Museum nearby, where one could grab a cup of hot coffee and enjoy the varied collection of paintings, costumes, furniture as well as multimedia exhibits about the people and industry in that area.

			<h1>風車</h1>
			<p>
				當提到荷蘭，許多人腦袋第一時間想到的大概就是那數量龐大的風車。荷蘭人與爭取國家的水源有著長久的淵源，也因此風車成為了其中一個解決方法。有著國家位處完美的地理位置，荷蘭人成功地運用風力並將其轉換為轉動的動力，用來從地漥地區抽水或磨碎農作物。據估計，當今荷蘭境內有著超過一千座風車，其中有些仍為了灌溉而運作中。難怪荷蘭有著「風車之國」的美名。
			</p>
			<p>
				在荷蘭的眾多景點之中，贊瑟斯漢斯以其保存良善的風車而聞名。因此，在我荷蘭之旅的第二天時，我便決定去造訪贊瑟斯漢斯。由於我住的地方距離贊瑟斯漢斯十分接近，我並沒花太多時間便抵達了那裡。當我踏下公車的那一刻，我便被眼前的壯觀風景給震懾住了。那些歷史悠久且保存良好的風車，和廣闊的平原和清澈的河流形成了迷人的景色。我當時的感受可說是無法用言語來形容的。
			</p>
			<p>
				還有一件事也讓我十分印象深刻—風。為了能讓風車們轉動起來，贊瑟斯漢斯的風可說是十分地強，而這可是從一位在「風城」新竹住了將近兩年的人口中說出。幸運地是，附近就是贊瑟斯博物館，提供著熱呼呼的咖啡讓人暖暖身子，同時也可以享受觀賞著有關當地人們和產業的畫作、服飾、傢俱的收藏展出以及多媒體的展覽。

			<h1>Apple Pie</h1>
			<p>
				The Netherlands is as well famous for its delicacies and street food, including the famous stroopwafel, patat (the Dutch version of French fries), cheese, fish and chips, and my favorite – the apple pie. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The Dutch apple pie looks more like a cake more than a pie. Unlike the normal apple pies, the Dutch apple pies (or appeltaart in Dutch) have the crust pressed into the bottom and the sides of the pan, forming a unique taste. I had the best apple pie in my life at Winkel 43, a local café in Amsterdam. The tasty fillings of firm and softer apples, raisins, nuts and the velvety texture matched perfectly. Not to mention the whipped cream on the top of the pie was the cherry on top. I couldn’t help but shoved down slices and slices of apple pies down my stomach. To sum up, one visits the Netherlands must try the legendary apple pies.

			<h1>蘋果派</h1>
			<p>
				荷蘭也以當地的佳餚和街頭小吃聞名，其中包括了有名的荷式鬆餅、荷式薯條（荷蘭版的薯條）、起司、炸魚薯條和我個人最愛的—蘋果派。
			</p>
			<p>
				荷式的蘋果派比起派看起來更像蛋糕。有別於一般的蘋果派，荷式的蘋果派（或荷蘭語中的蘋果餡餅）將酥脆的外圍壓入烤盤的兩側及底部，形成一個特殊的風味。我在阿姆斯特丹的一家當地咖啡廳—Winkel 43享用到了人生中最棒的蘋果派。那美味的內餡，包含著軟硬皆有的蘋果片、葡萄乾、堅果以及那鵝絨般入口即化的口感搭配得恰到好處。更不用說蘋果派上頭的鮮奶油更是錦上添花。總結來說，來到荷蘭請務必品嘗看看那傳奇的蘋果派。
