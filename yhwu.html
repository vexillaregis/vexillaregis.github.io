					Wu, Yu-Hsiu is currently a junior student in National Tsing Hua University. Recently reached the age 21, Wu has experienced quite a lot in his university life. Wu likes coding, riding motorbikes, photography and watching movies. As a student in the department of Foreign Languages and Literature, Wu is able to speak English fluently and is currently learning Spanish and Japanese. He has also taken many linguistics courses, including syntax, child language acquisition, phonetics, phonology, semantics, sociolinguistics, and psycholinguistics. Among these courses, Wu finds sociolinguistics being the most interesting, for it reveals the link between social factors and linguistic choices. Apart from that, he is as well taking the course of Bilingual Web Design, which he is currently working on.
